# Marine provinces with occurrence of mangroves

We used marine provinces from the [Marine Ecoregions of the World](/MangrovesData/MEOW-ecoregions.Rmd) as templates for ecoregionalization of level 4 units. 

We intersected the distribution of mangrove occurrence polygons from several sources with the marine provinces described above. You can check the documentation of data sources in the [Data Folder](/MangrovesData/).

Mangroves are present in at least 37 and at most 42 marine provinces, depending on the source. This table shows the approx. area totals for the USGS mangrove data from 2000 (Giri et al. 2011) and the Biophysical typology map for the year 2016 (Worthington et al. 2020):

Area in the table are expressed in km^2.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
load("prov-data.rda")
prov_summary %>% st_drop_geometry %>% transmute(PROV_CODE,PROVINCE,`Area 2020`=area_2020 %>% set_units('km^2') %>% round(2),`Area 2016`=radius %>% set_units('m^2') %>% set_units('km^2') %>%  round(2)) -> dts

 DT::renderDataTable({dts})
```

There are four provinces with very small areas in 2000 and no occurrences in the 2016 data. These might have been marginal occurrences. The Lusitanian province included ca. 10km^2 according to the older dataset (occurrence in the Canary Islands), but has no occurrences in the new dataset. *Is this absence correct?*

The Central Polynesia and Hawaii provinces also have very small occurrences. According to Mark Spalding these are non-native.

### Interactive map

We show the intersection between the 2016 occurrences from Worthington et al. (2020) and the Marine Provinces in the [interactive map](/MangrovesMap/) (also available at <https://ecosphere.shinyapps.io/Mangrove-L4-map/>).
 
The density of mangrove polygons is shown as a heat map (warmer colors indicate higher density) and it changes with the zoom level. You can zoom using the plus and minus bottoms in the upper left corner of the map or by double clicking in a location of the map. You can pan over the map using the keyboard arrows or by holding the mouse button and dragging the mouse. 
 
Hovering the mouse over a province will highlight its boundaries and show the name. When you click on the province it will update the plot and table at the bottom of the screen. Plot shows the breakdown of area or number of polygons per combination of class and sedimentar in the selected province. 
 
The table shows preliminary statistics calculated for the mangrove polygons within each province. Area is given in km^2 for the year 2016, Area change in % (between 1996 and 2016); EOO: extent of occurrence in km^2; AOO: area of occupancy (number of 10x10 km cells); AOO_m: AOO cells with > 1km^2 occupancy. These statistics are used in assessment of spatial criteria and give an idea of decline and exposure to threats.
 
We have highlighted some issues on the map using red round markers. Click on the markers to see the suggestions or questions.
