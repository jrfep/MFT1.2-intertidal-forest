# Step 1: Marine provinces with occurrence of mangrove species and mangrove forest

As suggested in the guidelines we used marine provinces from the [Marine Ecoregions of the World](/MangrovesData/MEOW-ecoregions.Rmd) as templates for ecoregionalization of level 4 units.

We intersected the distribution of marine provinces and ecoregions described above with:

- a) Range maps of 77 key mangrove species from the Red List of Threatened Species database, and
- b) Mangrove ecosystem occurrence polygons from several sources (Giri et al. 2011; Worthington et al. 2020)

Documentation of data sources in the [Data Folder](/MangrovesData/).

Mangrove species distribution intersects with at least 47 marine provinces, while mangrove ecosystem are present in at least 37 and at most 42 marine provinces, depending on the source.

The map and table show the information for the selected group of provinces. The table gives the approx. area totals for the USGS mangrove data from 2000 (Giri et al. 2011), the Biophysical typology map for the year 2016 (Worthington et al. 2020), and the number of key mangrove species according to IUCN Red List of Threatened Species database. Area of mangrove ecosystem in the table are expressed in km^2.

## Reasons for excluding provinces

There are two provinces with very small areas of mangrove ecosystems in 2000 (<1 km^2) and no occurrences in the 2016 data.  Five further provinces only have data on species distribution but mangrove ecosystems have not been detected. As discussed in the workshop small patches of mangrove forest might remain undetected in this areas but current evidence suggest this is unlikely the case in these areas.

The Lusitanian province included ca. 10 km^2  of mangrove ecosystems according to the older dataset but this is likely an error. According to workshop participants, the Canary Islands do not have mangroves. Northern mangrove limit is/was in the Park National du Banc d'Arguin  in Mauritania on the mainland a few kms north of Iouik. These were individual trees. The northernmost patches were located around Nouamghar (Cape Timirist), still within the PNBA.

## Non-native occurrences

We marked four provinces as non-native occurrences when the occurrences are well known and generally accepted to be introduced by humnas (World Mangrove Atlas Ch 10):

- _Rhizophora stylosa_ is considered introduced in French Polynesia (Meyer et al. 2021)
- _Bruguiera gymnorhiza_ may have been introduced in the Marshall islands (Spenneman, 1998) and perhaps even Nypa into eastern Micronesia (Duke, 2008).
- More recently introductions have brought mangroves to most of the main islands of Hawaii (Smith, 1996).

These populations should not be assesed using IUCN RLE protocol and should not be considered of  conservation concern.

There are also other regions where some mangrove species have been introduced and have become invasive. Some examples were mentioned during the workshop: Nypa in W-Africa, and other species in China (South China Sea?).

## Provinces included with or without modifications

We will cover the changes in the following steps:


|  | |  |
|---|---|---|
|Step 1| Intersection of mangrove with marine provinces | This document
|Step 2| Merge neighboring provinces | [LINK](Step-2-merge-provinces.Rmd)
|Step 3| Split provinces | [LINK](Step-3-split-provinces.Rmd)
|Step 4| Boundary shifts between provinces | [LINK](Step-4-shift-borders.Rmd)
