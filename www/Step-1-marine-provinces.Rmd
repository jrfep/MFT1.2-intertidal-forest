# Step 1: Marine provinces with occurrence of mangrove species and mangrove forest

As suggested in the guidelines we used marine provinces from the [Marine Ecoregions of the World](/MangrovesData/MEOW-ecoregions.Rmd) as templates for ecoregionalization of level 4 units.

We intersected the distribution of marine provinces and ecoregions described above with:

- a) Range maps of 77 key mangrove species from the Red List of Threatened Species database, and
- b) Mangrove ecosystem occurrence polygons from several sources (Giri et al. 2011; Worthington et al. 2020)

Documentation of data sources in the [Data Folder](/MangrovesData/).

Mangrove species distribution intersects with at least 47 marine provinces, while mangrove ecosystem are present in at least 37 and at most 42 marine provinces, depending on the source.

The map and table show the information for the selected group of provinces. The table gives the approx. area totals for the USGS mangrove data from 2000 (Giri et al. 2011), the Biophysical typology map for the year 2016 (Worthington et al. 2020), and the number of key mangrove species according to IUCN Red List of Threatened Species database. Area of mangrove ecosystem in the table are expressed in km^2.

## Reasons for excluding provinces/ecoregions

Some ecoregions lack evidence of mangrove ecosystems in the global distribution maps, although neighboring ecoregions from the same marine province do have mangrove occurrences, and the distribution maps of key mangrove species partially overlap these areas. As discussed in the workshop small patches of mangrove forest might remain undetected in these ecoregions. Thus we **retained** these ecoregions as part of the larger marine provinces for the purpose of delimitation of assessment units.

The _Lusitanian_ province included ca. 10 km^2  of mangrove ecosystems in the 2000 map (Giri et al. 2011) but this is likely an error. According to workshop participants, the Canary Islands do not have mangroves. Northern mangrove limit is/was in the Park National du Banc d'Arguin  in Mauritania on the mainland a few kms north of Iouik. These were individual trees. The northernmost patches were located around Nouamghar (Cape Timirist), still within the PNBA. Thus we will **exclude** the _Lusitanian_ province.

## Known but unmapped occurrences

We **include** three ecoregions where the global maps did not detect occurrence of mangrove but we are aware of literature records describing these occurrences:

- Maldives in the _Central Indian Ocean Islands_ Province (Kathiresan & Rajendran 2005),
- Lord Howe and Norfolk Islands (Department of Environment and Climate Change (NSW) 2007),
- [Bunbury, Western Australia](https://www.fish.wa.gov.au/Documents/recreational_fishing/fact_sheets/fact_sheet_mangroves.pdf)) in the Leeuwin Ecoregion, _Southwest Australian Shelf_ Province.

## Non-native occurrences

We marked four provinces as **non-native occurrences** when the occurrences are well known and generally accepted to be introduced by humans (World Mangrove Atlas Ch 10):

- _Rhizophora stylosa_ is considered introduced in French Polynesia (Meyer et al. 2021)
- _Bruguiera gymnorhiza_ may have been introduced in the Marshall islands (Spenneman, 1998) and perhaps even Nypa into eastern Micronesia (Duke, 2008).
- More recently introductions have brought mangroves to most of the main islands of Hawaii (Smith, 1996).

These populations should not be assesed using IUCN RLE protocol and should not be considered of  conservation concern.

There are also other regions where some mangrove species have been introduced and have become invasive. Some examples were mentioned during the workshop: Nypa in W-Africa, and other species in China (South China Sea?).

## Provinces included with or without modifications

We will cover the changes in the following steps:

|  | |  |
|---|---|---|
|Step 1| Intersection of mangrove with marine provinces | This document
|Step 2| Merge neighboring provinces | [LINK](Step-2-merge-provinces.Rmd)
|Step 3| Split provinces | [LINK](Step-3-split-provinces.Rmd)
|Step 4| Boundary shifts between provinces | [LINK](Step-4-shift-borders.Rmd)
