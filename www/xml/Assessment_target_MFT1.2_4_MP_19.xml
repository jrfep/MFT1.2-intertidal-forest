      <AT-description lang="en">The 'Mangroves of Somali/Arabian' is a regional ecosystem subgroup (level 4 unit of the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology) that includes intertidal forest and shrublands of the marine ecoregions of Arabian (Persian) Gulf (Somali/Arabian province), Central Somali Coast (Somali/Arabian province), Gulf of Oman (Somali/Arabian province), Western Arabian Sea (Somali/Arabian province). The biota is characterised by 10 species of true mangroves and other key plant taxa that provide structure and resources for other mangove-associated taxa. Mangroves in this subgroup have a mapped extent of at least ... km2 in ... countries and are predominantly ... and .... They are threatened by  conversion for urban and tourism development, agriculture and aquaculture, and by increases in frequency of tropical storms. </AT-description>

    <Abiotic-environment>
      <Abiotic-Summaries>
        <Abiotic-Summary lang="en">Many mangrove soils are low in nutrients, especially nitrogen and phosphorus. Regional distributions are influenced by interactions among landscape position, rainfall, hydrology, sea level, sediment dynamics, subsidence, storm-driven processes, and disturbance by pests and predators. Rainfall and sediment supply from rivers and currents promote mangrove establishment and persistence, while waves and large tidal currents destabilise and erode mangrove substrates, mediating local-scale dynamics in ecosystem distributions. High rainfall reduces salinity stress and increases nutrient loading from adjacent catchments, while tidal flushing also regulates salinity.</Abiotic-Summary>

    <Biotic-processes>
      <Processes-Summaries>
        <Processes-Summary lang="en">Mangroves are structural engineers and possess traits including pneumatophores, salt excretion glands, vivipary, and propagule buoyancy that promote survival and recruitment in poorly aerated, saline, mobile, and tidally inundated substrates. They are highly efficient in nitrogen use efficiency and nutrient resorption. They produce large amounts of detritus (e.g. leaves, twigs, and bark), which is either buried in waterlogged sediments, consumed by crabs, or more commonly decomposed by fungi and bacteria, mobilising carbon and nutrients to higher trophic levels. These ecosystems are also major blue carbon sinks, incorporating organic matter into sediments and living biomass. Although highly productive, these ecosystems are less speciose than other coastal biogenic systems. Crabs are among the most abundant and important invertebrates. Their burrows oxygenate sediments, enhance groundwater penetration, and provide habitat for other invertebrates such as molluscs and worms. Specialised roots (pneumatophores) provide a complex habitat structure that protects juvenile fish from predators and serves as hard substrate for the attachment of algae as well as sessile and mobile invertebrates (e.g. oysters, mussels, sponges, and gastropods). Mangrove canopies support invertebrate herbivores and other terrestrial biota including invertebrates, reptiles, small mammals, and extensive bird communities. </Processes-Summary>

Urbanisation and the associated coastal development, over-harvesting, and pollution from domestic, industrial and agricultural land use urbanisation (coastal development). The position of mangrove forests in intertidal areas renders them vulnerable to predicted sea-level rise as a result of climate change. Tropical storms can damage mangrove forests through direct defoliation and destruction of trees, as well as through the mass mortality of animal communities within the ecosystems. </Threats-Summary>
