# Step 4: Shift borders between provinces


We evaluated the boundaries of four provinces with close occurrences from an adjacent ecoregion. Workshop participant suggested to keep the boundaries of North Brazil and Agulhas as they stand. The boundaries of the West Central Australian Shelf and the Southwest Australian Shelf require adjustments to make sure that isolated Mangrove occurrences are assessed with their nearest neighbors.

| Province | Adjacent unit | Decision | comments |
|---|---|---|---|
|North Brazil|northern boundary|Keep|N coast of Trinidad distinct from continental shelf|
|North Brazil|southern boundary|Keep|Edge of extensive deltaic/mangrove coast|
|Agulhas| |Keep|Coastal vegetation changes at Cape Vidal|
|West Central Australian Shelf|Bunbury (Unmapped)|Modified|See below|
|Southwest Australian Shelf|Coroong Lagoon|Modified|See below |

### West Central Australian Shelf

There are unmapped mangrove ecosystems in [Bunbury, Western Australia](https://www.fish.wa.gov.au/Documents/recreational_fishing/fact_sheets/fact_sheet_mangroves.pdf). This may be a distinctive relict that should be treated as a separate unit from SW Aust shelf. It is closer to the Mangroves in the West Central Australian shelf.

So we combined the polygon of the Leeuwin ecoregion with the West Central Australian Shelf province to create a single assessment unit.

### SW Australian Shelf /SE Australian Shelf

There is one occurrence of mangrove ecosystems in the Coroong Lagoons. This is close to the border between the  Southwest and Southeast Australian Shelf provinces, but is closer to the group of Mangrove occurrences near Adelaide that to the ones in the Bassian ecoregion (near Melbourne in Victoria).

The border between the states of Victoria and South Australia coincides with a narrowing shelf that probably separated these populations (Sinclair et al. 2016).

So we defined an assessment unit for South Australia that includes the following three ecoregions: Great Australian Bight, South Australian Gulfs and Western Bassian.
