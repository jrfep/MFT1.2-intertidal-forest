# Step 3: Split provinces

Questions:


Australia: CL: there are mangroves in Bunbury, Western Australia

Australian shelves: CL: I think the mangroves to the east of of the Southwestern Australian Shelf  province should be included within that province - the shelf narrows - so that narrowing of the shelf probably separates those populations - but I might have to chase down the genetic data - FLindersia region vs. Maugea and Peronia regions  Sinclair, E.A., Anthony, J.M., Greer, D., Ruiz‐Montoya, L., Evans, S.M., Krauss, S.L. and Kendrick, G.A., 2016.

Southwest Aust shelf – Extent the boundary slightly eastwards to include all South Australian patches, which are disjunct from those in Victoria.
SW Australia – Bunbury patch (unmapped) may be distinctive relict that should be treated as a separate unit from SW Aust shelf

North Brazil shelf (southern boundary): Yes - this is the edge of the extensive deltaic/mangrove coast (northern boundary): This is probably fine - the N coast of Trinidad is distinct from the continental shelf margins of the rest of the island, with much more in common with the Caribbean Islands

Agulhas: I think this is correct - it is drawn at Cape Vidal and changes in coastal vegetation were part of definition of this boundary
