# Mangroves in the IUCN Global Ecosystem typology

Mangroves are classified as a ecosystem functional group (level 3 unit) named *MFT1.2 Intertidal forests and shrublands*:

> Mangroves create structurally complex and productive ecosystems in the intertidal zone of depositional coasts, around tropical and warm temperate regions. The biota includes aquatic and terrestrial species, and intertidal specialists. Large volumes of mangrove leaves and twigs are decomposed by fungi and bacteria, mobilising carbon and nutrients for invertebrates such as crabs, worms and snails. Shellfish and juvenile fish are protected from desiccation and predators amongst mangrove roots. Mangrove canopies support many terrestrial species, particularly birds. These forests are important carbon sinks, retaining organic matter in sediments and living biomass.

The full profile of this ecosystem functional group can be located at <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MFT1.2>. Please check the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology report (Keith et al. 2020) for more details on the typology.

## Global mangroves distribution

Currently the indicative map of this ecosystem functional group is based on the mangrove distribution data of Giri et al. (2011). But this will be updated after this workshop. 

So far the *IUCN Red List of Ecosystem* assessments that focus on mangrove are mostly concerned with local or national units. The continental assessment of forest of the Americas (Ferrer-Paris et al. 2019) include two large mangrove units (Atlantic and Caribbean vs. Pacific Mangroves), but did not consider further subdivision of the units, and did not consider the marine components of the mangrove ecosystems.

## Regional ecosystem subgroups (level 4 units)

In order to define the boundaries of ecoregional units we evaluate two aspects:

- [Intersection of mangrove occurrences with Marine provinces](marine-provinces.Rmd)
- [Biotic similarity of mangrove associated biota between Marine provinces](mangrove-species.Rmd)
