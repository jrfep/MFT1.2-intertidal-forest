# Mangroves in the IUCN Global Ecosystem typology

Mangroves are classified as a ecosystem functional group (level 3 unit) named *MFT1.2 Intertidal forests and shrublands*:

> Mangroves create structurally complex and productive ecosystems in the intertidal zone of depositional coasts, around tropical and warm temperate regions. The biota includes aquatic and terrestrial species, and intertidal specialists. Large volumes of mangrove leaves and twigs are decomposed by fungi and bacteria, mobilising carbon and nutrients for invertebrates such as crabs, worms and snails. Shellfish and juvenile fish are protected from desiccation and predators amongst mangrove roots. Mangrove canopies support many terrestrial species, particularly birds. These forests are important carbon sinks, retaining organic matter in sediments and living biomass.

The full profile of this ecosystem functional group can be located at <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MFT1.2>. Please check the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology report (Keith et al. 2020) for more details on the typology.

## Regional ecosystem subgroups (level 4 units)

In order to define the boundaries of ecoregional units we evaluate two aspects:

- [Intersection of mangrove occurrences with Marine provinces](marine-provinces.Rmd)
- [Biotic similarity of mangrove associated biota between Marine provinces](mangrove-species.Rmd)
