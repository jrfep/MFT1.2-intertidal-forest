# Towards a global assessment of mangrove ecosystems

## Aim
The project aims to produce the first global Red List assessment of mangrove ecosystems. This will add value to Red List assessments of individual mangrove species because it takes into account whole assemblages of species associated with mangroves, as well as the ecological processes that sustain the functioning of mangrove ecosystems. Individual mangrove species may be ranked Least Concern, but some of their populations may be components of threatened ecosystems. Conversely, some species that live in mangrove ecosystems may be ranked as threatened in the Red List of Threatened Species, even if they occur within non threatened mangrove ecosystems.

## Units of assessment

The units to be assessed for Red Listing first need to be defined and mapped. The Global Ecosystem Typology provides a useful framework to guide this task. The worldâ€™s mangrove ecosystem share a number of functional features and, for this reason, are grouped together in a single Ecosystem Functional Group at Level 3 of the typology <https://global-ecosystems.org/explore/groups/MFT1.2>. Please check the IUCN Global Ecosystem Typology report (Keith et al. 2020) for more details on the typology.

Level 4 of the Global Ecosystem Typology allows mangroves to be subdivided to recognise different ecoregional expressions of mangrove ecosystems. The Global Mangrove Atlas provides globally consistent spatial information on the distribution of these ecosystems.
To support a useful global Red List of Mangrove ecosystems, we need a manageable number of assessment units that are informative about important variation in biodiversity associated with mangroves around the world. A workable number of global assessment units could be in the range of 20-60 units. Marine ecoregions and provinces (Spalding et al. 2008) provide a useful starting point for delineating these mangrove units. Marine provinces and the marine ecoregions within them were developed to represent biogeographic patterns in all coastal marine biota (not only mangrove systems), with appropriate adjustment, they should be suitable for Red List assessment because they serve as biogeographic proxies for compositionally different mangrove ecosystems.

### Guiding principles for definition of assessment units

To guide experts in making adjustments, we propose the following criteria:

  1. Preferably use marine provinces instead of ecoregions to define mangrove ecosystem assessment units, except in the cases mentioned below;
  2. Lump adjacent provinces to define larger mangrove ecosystem assessment units where: a) one province has a relative small number of mangrove occurrences, b) there is reasonable evidence that are no discernible differences in species composition (not only of mangroves themselves but of major groups of associated biota) and no reason to assess their status separately, and c) both provinces share similar climatic conditions (avoid merging one temperate with one tropical province); Example: Should the Tropical Central Polynesia be lumped with Tropical Southwestern Pacific?
  3. Split an marine province to define separate mangrove ecosystem assessment units where there is reasonable evidence of large differences or heterogeneity in species composition (or where it could be inferred by ecological barriers, currents or disjunctions, or climatic gradients) such that the resulting units of mangroves should be assessed separately (i.e. loss of either of the resulting units would result in a significant loss of biodiversity). Consider whether splitting provinces according to ecoregion boundaries resolves issues of heterogeneity; Example: Split West and South Indian shelf province along ecoregional boundary to treat Sri Lankan mangroves as a separate unit to west Indian coast to recognise contrasting biota in those regions.
  4. Shift boundaries of provinces to refine delineation of mangrove ecosystem assessment units where it aligns better with discontinuities in mangrove distribution. Consider whether merging one province with and adjacent ecoregion will resolve the issue; Example: Shift eastern boundary of Southwest Australian shelf province to the east so it includes nearby mangroves associated with the Coorong lagoon and Murray River mouth.
  5. Where knowledge of mangrove local ecosystems is uncertain, the default option should be to leave ecoregion boundaries as they stand.

The implementation of these steps is documented in detail in the following documents:

### Interactive map

We show the intersection between the 2016 occurrences from Worthington et al. (2020) and the Marine Provinces in the [interactive map](/MangrovesMap/) (also available at <https://ecosphere.shinyapps.io/Mangrove-L4-map/>).

The density of mangrove polygons is shown as a heat map (warmer colors indicate higher density) and it changes with the zoom level. You can zoom using the plus and minus bottoms in the upper left corner of the map or by double clicking in a location of the map. You can pan over the map using the keyboard arrows or by holding the mouse button and dragging the mouse.

Hovering the mouse over a province will highlight its boundaries and show the name. When you click on the province it will update the plot and table at the bottom of the screen. Plot shows the breakdown of area or number of polygons per combination of class and sedimentar in the selected province.

The table shows preliminary statistics calculated for the mangrove polygons within each province. Area is given in km^2 for the year 2016, Area change in % (between 1996 and 2016); EOO: extent of occurrence in km^2; AOO: area of occupancy (number of 10x10 km cells); AOO_m: AOO cells with > 1km^2 occupancy. These statistics are used in assessment of spatial criteria and give an idea of decline and exposure to threats.

We have highlighted some issues on the map using red round markers. Click on the markers to see the suggestions or questions.
